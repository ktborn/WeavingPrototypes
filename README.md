Goal: visualize possible weaving designs for a specific loom. Tweak colors, sizes, combinations

Loom type: inkle loom. Intended for long, narrow items such as belts, bands, keychains, lanyards, shoelaces, etc. 
I am not considering hand manipulations or pickup of threads. The pattern in the woven item is determined by what threads are initially strung on the loom. 

Basic weaving has a repeating AB pattern. Turned Krokbragd allows for a repeating ABAC pattern.
